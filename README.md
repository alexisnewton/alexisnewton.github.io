  <b> About Me</b>
  <hr>
  <ul>

My name is Alexis Newton, and I am a fifth-year doctoral candidate at Emory University. I am on the job market this year.
         My advisor is <a href="https://dmzb.github.io/" target="_blank">David Zureick-Brown</a>.
	 Generally, I am interested in Arithmetic Geometry and Number Theory, with a preference for computational research.

</p><p>
         I earned my MA in Mathematics at Wake Forest University under <a href="http://users.wfu.edu/rouseja/" target="_blank">Jeremy Rouse</a> in 2020, and I earned my BA in Mathematics and English Writing at High Point University in 2018.

</p><p> Previously, I was a co-organizer of <a href = "https://sites.google.com/view/emorygradalgntseminar/home">RANT</a> - Emory's weekly graduate student seminar in algebra and number theory, with <a href="https://sarangop1728.github.io/index.html">Santiago Arango-Pineros.</a>
